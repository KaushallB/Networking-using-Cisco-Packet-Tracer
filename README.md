# Networking using Cisco Packet Tracer - Static & Dynamic Routing

This repository contains various **network topology simulations** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
Each `.pkt` file demonstrates different networking concepts such as **static routing, dynamic routing, topology structures, and router configurations**.

##  **Topologies and Routing Configurations**

| Topology | Description | Screenshot |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Bus Topology** | A **bus network** where all devices share a common communication line. | ![Bus Topology](./screenshots/bustopology.png) |
| **Mesh Topology** | A **fully connected** network with multiple redundant paths. | ![Mesh Topology](./screenshots/meshtpology.png) |
| **Ring Topology** | A **ring-based network** where each device is connected to two other devices. | ![Ring Topology](./screenshots/ringtopology.png) |
| **Star Topology** | A network where all devices are **connected to a central hub or switch**. | ![Star Topology](./screenshots/startopology.png) |
| **Static Routing** | **Manually configured routes** to enable communication between different networks. | ![Static Routing](./screenshots/staticrouting.png) |
| **Dynamic Routing (RIP)** | Demonstrates **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** for automatic route learning. | ![Dynamic Routing](./screenshots/dynamicrouting.png) |
| **Router Configuration** | A **basic router setup** with IP addressing and interface configuration. | ![Router Configuration](./screenshots/routerconfig.png) |
